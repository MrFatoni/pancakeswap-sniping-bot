## IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE RUNNING THE BOT

1) The bot uses a wallet address and see phrase - this needs to be the **FIRST ACCOUNT** (Account0 by default) that was created by default when you installed metamask on your pc / macbook. 
    - if this is **NOT** configured correctly you will get an error that says "(node:45320) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost"

2) Make **sure** you have the following assets in your MetaMask wallet **FOR THE ACCOUNT ADDRESS WITH WHICH YOU ARE USING THE BOT**
    - BNB (this is needed for gas)
    - WBNB (this is used to purchase the desired token)
    - IF you want to TEST the bot using WBNB / BUSD, then ADD the BUSD custom token to your MetaMask (0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56)
    - Run the bot using the to_Purchase value of the BUSD token contract. This works because liquidity is frequently added to this pool.

3) **APPROVE WBNB** in your MetaMask
    - you need to approve your wallet to spend WBNB in order for the bot to be able to make purchases
    - to do this, go to pancakeswap, and in FROM put WBNB, and in the TO put elongate (0x2A9718defF471f3Bb91FA0ECEAB14154F150a385), and click 'Approve'.
    - confirm the transaction in MetaMask
    - Now WBNB should be approved, and the purchase transactions the bot will make on your wallets behalf using WBNB will not fail.


## BOT SETUP & CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Download & Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/ - 14.16.1 LTS is fine

2) Extract the bot zip / download contents to a folder, example C:\users\username\Downloads\pancakeswap-sniping-bot\

3) install node dependencies
    - open command prompt
    - cd C:\users\username\Downloads\pancakeswap-sniping-bot\
    - npm init
    - npm install ethers
    - npm install chalk
    - npm install express

4) open package.json file inside your directory, example C:\users\username\Downloads\pancakeswap-sniping-bot\, and make sure it contains:
    - "type": "module",
    - this should be on line 6, after the line "main": "bot.js",
    - entire package.json should be:
        - {
            "name": "trading-bot",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "",
            "main": "bot.js",
            "type": "module",
            "scripts": {
                "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
            },
            "author": "",
            "license": "ISC",
            "dependencies": {
                "chalk": "^4.1.1",
                "ethers": "^5.1.4",
                "express": "^4.17.1"
              }
            }

5) open bot.js and input:
    - the contract address of the token you want to purchase on line 10
        - you can use BUSD as an example, as the WBNB / BUSD liquidity pool gets additions every few minutes
    - your wallet address on line 13
    - the amount of WBNB of the token you want to purchase on line 14
    - the slippage required to purchase the token on pancakeswap on line 15
        - you will need to MAKE SURE the slippage is set correctly for each token you plan to purchase
    - the seed phrase of your wallet on line 23

6) save the changes to bot.js

7) Run the bot
    - open the command prompt (it should be in the same directory it was earlier when you issued node commands)
    - type 'node bot' and hit ENTER to run the bot
    - you should see the bot listening for liquidity addition to pancakeswap in your command prompt window
